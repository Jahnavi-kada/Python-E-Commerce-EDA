# Python-E-Commerce-EDA
E-Commerce Retail Data Analysis is to understand customer behavior and trend using their point of sales data.

## Technologies Used
* Python: The core programming language for data analysis and visualization.
* Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical computations.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* Jupyter Notebook: An interactive coding environment for documenting and sharing analysis results.

## Objectives
* To gain a general overview of the e-commerce dataset and its contents.
* To clean and preprocess data, thereby handling missing values, removing duplicates, and resolving inconsistencies.
* To visualize data in order to identify interesting patterns, trends, and potential outliers.
* To perform basic statistical analysis to answer relevant business questions pertaining to sales and customer behavior.
* To understand customer profiles through segmentation and grouping analyses, thereby providing insights into purchasing patterns.

## Process to run Analysis 
### Load dataset
 df = pd.read_csv('ecommerce_data.csv')  # Replace with your file path

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and perform any necessary data type conversions and cleaning processes.

### Data Visualization:
 Use visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, bar charts) to explore various aspects of the dataset.

### Statistical Analysis:
 Apply basic statistical methods to investigate the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

## Conclusion
This ReadMe file outlines the structure of an exploratory data analysis project focused on e-commerce data using Python. It details the dataset, objectives, required technologies, and steps required to execute the analysis. â€‹Ultimately, the insights derived from this project can significantly aid businesses in making informed decisions that enhance performance and customer satisfaction within the e-commerce space.
